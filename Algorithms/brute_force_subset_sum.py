# Brute Force Subset Sum

# Exponential time
# O(2^n) time complexity
# Slow and not to be used

# Given a set of integers and a target value, /
# this algorithm checks all possible subsets of the set to determine if any subset's sum equals the target value. The number of subsets grows exponentially with the input size.
