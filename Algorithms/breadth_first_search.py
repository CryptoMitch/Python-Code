# Breadth First Search (BFS) Algorithm
# Summary: Traverse or search through data structures like graphs or trees level by level.
# Time Complexity: 
# Space Complexity:

# Import module to support adding and subtracting elements from both ends
from collections import deque

# Start at the root(AKA arbitrary or inital) node in a graph



# Explore neighbours



# Move to the next level of the queue


    # Do this until the queue is empty





# Implement Graph that is the Adjacency list

    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F', 'G'],
    'D': [],

# Pick start node from graph
