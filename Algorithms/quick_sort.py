# Quick Sort Algorithm (Often used)

# Divide and Conquer Algorithm using Pivots and partitioning into two sub arrays

# Best Time Complexity: O(n log (n)) - when dividing into equal halves
# Average Time Complexity: O(n log (n)) 
# Worst Time Complexity: O(O n^2) - when a pivot is chosen poorly and creates unbalanced subarrays

# Space Complexity: O(n log (n)) - quite efficient for memory usage because of the recursion stack
