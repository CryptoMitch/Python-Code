# Here is a famous quote by Winston Churchill

#string concatenation

author = "Franklin D. Roosevelt"
funnyAuthor = "Dranklin R. Foosevelt"
noun1 = input{"Noun 1: "}
noun2 = input{"Noun 2: "}
noun3 = input{"Noun 3: "}
noun4 = input{"Noun 4: "}


madlib = f"The only Limit to our {noun1} of {noun2} will be our {noun3} of {noun4}. - {funnyAuthor} "
