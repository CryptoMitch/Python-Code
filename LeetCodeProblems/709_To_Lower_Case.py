# 709. To Lower Case

# Given a string s, return the string after replacing every uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter.

# This code is unnecessarily easy. I will refactor in the future to take up less memory.


class Solution:
    def toLowerCase(self, s: str) -> str:
        return (s.lower())
